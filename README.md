#Forest Ecosystem Values

Forest Ecosystem Values provides an estimate of the economic values of several non-market ecosystem services provided by the forests in Texas. Currently, estimated values of forest ecosystem services are available for air quality, biodiversity, carbon, cultural, and watershed services. 
 
The estimates shown are based on an analysis of forest resources in the area, results of existing literature, and non-market valuation techniques. Ecosystem service values are also reported by the contribution of FIA-defined forests in rural and urban areas. Texas A&M Forest Service is currently assessing ecosystem service values for forests and trees in urban and community areas throughout the state, and will add the results to this application upon completion. 
 
The results should be viewed as conservative estimates, and are only part of a larger suite of ecosystem services provided by the forest within the area of interest. All values are reported in 2011 constant United States dollar.
